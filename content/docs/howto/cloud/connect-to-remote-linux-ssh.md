## Windows

### Option 1: Built-in SSH (Windows 10 and higher)

Windows 10 and higher ship with a built-in [OpenSSH Client](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_overview)

Verify OpenSSH is installed on your computer by opening a command line prompt and executing `ssh -V`. If you see an output similar to the following, you have OpenSSH installed:

```shell
C:\>ssh -V
OpenSSH_for_Windows_8.1p1, LibreSSL 3.0.2
```

In order to connect to an SSH Server you need the following:

- The IP Address or [FQDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name) of the server
- The username of the account and
- Either the password or the private key (.pem) of the account you want to connect to

The syntax for connecting to an SSH Server is as follows:

```shell
ssh <username>@<server-ip|FQDN> -i <private-pem-key-file>
```

Example:

- IP: `10.0.0.1`
- Username: `ubuntu`
- Private key file: `c:\users\ipse\ssh\workhaus.pem`

```text
ssh ubuntu@10.0.0.1 -i c:\users\ipse\ssh\workhaus.pem
```

### Option 2: Putty SSH Client

Install Putty from [here](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).

#### Without private key

Open Putty, enter the server IP or FQDN and click on "Open". A shell window will open which queries you for the username and password.

#### With private key

When using Putty, the private key file needs to be in the Putty key file format `ppk`. If your key file is in the `pem` format
(as for example generated by AWS) you need to convert it to the Putty format first. You can use `puttygen` for that (see below).

[![Enter KeyFile](/images/howto/cloud/ssh-remote-machine/putty-key.png)](/images/howto/cloud/ssh-remote-machine/putty-key.png)

Click on "Open" and a shell window will open where you need to enter your username and also the passphrase for the PPK key file if any was specified.

##### Optional: Convert PEM to PPK

Download puttygen from [here](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) and open it. Click on
"Import Key" in the Conversions menu and select your pem key file.

I recommend adding a comment to the key to identify it. If you want, you can also save the key with a passphrase.

[![Save Key](/images/howto/cloud/ssh-remote-machine/puttygen-save.png)](/images/howto/cloud/ssh-remote-machine/puttygen-save.png)

Click "Save Private Key" to save the PPK file which can be used by Putty.
